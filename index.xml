      <description>Neural networks typically have very large number of parameters. Depending on whether they have more parameters than training instances, they are over-parameterized or under-parameterized. In either case, their loss function is a multivariable, multidimensional and often non-convex function. In this post, we study over-parameterized neural networks and their loss landscape; we answer the question of why gradient descent (GD) and its variants converge to global minima in over-parameterized neural networks, even though their loss function is non-convex.</description>

      <description>News Amazon science published an article on my experience teaching in Stanford while working in Amazon. I was interviewed by Jay Shah on his podcast on recommendation system, being an applied scientist and building a research career. Research I am an applied scientist in Amazon. My research interests are large language models, hyperparameter optimization, transfer learning, recommendation engines, scalable machine learning, and online algorithms.
In the past couple of years, I have worked on ranking and recommendation engines for Alexa Video.</description>
